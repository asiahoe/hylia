## Who is Gynesys?



I'm Asia. I've been playing games since I was 2. One of my earliest memories is me sitting nestled between Mom and Dad while they play _Super Mario World_. Every once in a while they would pass me the controller. But I didn't really come into my own as a gamer until I started playing _Sonic the Hedgehog_ on the Sega Genesis. My gamertag, Gynesys, is a homage to those origins and a wink to my femininity.



While I didn't always understand what was going on, I quickly tapped into the magic that games have to offer. Games have been the genesis of most of my interests, including reading, writing, art, comics, design, and code. They fueled my imagination and my self-confidence. Games have taught me that every failure is a valuable lesson that can only improve your gameplay going forward. Your next life is just a matter of perspective. Never give up, and always remember to take a break!
