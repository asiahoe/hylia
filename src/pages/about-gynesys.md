## What is Gynesys?

* My gaming alias across all platforms.
* A blog about gaming and all my interests.

It's pronounced like “genesis,” by the way.

## Who is Gynesys?

Hello there, I'm Asia! I've been playing games since I was 2. One of my earliest memories is me sitting nestled between Mom and Dad while they play *Super Mario World*. Every once in a while they would pass me the controller. But I didn't really come into my own as a gamer until I started playing *Sonic the Hedgehog* on the Sega Genesis. My gamertag, Gynesys, is a homage to those origins and a wink to my femininity.

While I didn't always understand what was going on, I quickly tapped into the magic that games have to offer. Games have been the genesis of most of my interests, including reading, writing, art, comics, design, and code. They fueled my imagination and my self-confidence.

> Games have taught me that every failure is a valuable lesson that can only improve your gameplay going forward. “next life” is just a matter of perspective.

Never give up, and always remember to take a break!

## What's This All About?

This website is my home on the web and a place for me to discuss some of my favorite topics and ideas, including:

* gaming
* gadgets
* grubbing
* globe-trotting
* girlishness
* glory

Right now it's a little barebones, but in time I will furnish it with a new design and fresh content, little by little.

### Did You Make This?

Yup! By day, I'm a UX/UI Designer, and over the years, I've learned a little about front-end development (code) as well. While my skills are intermediate at best, I know just enough to build a website with a modern toolset. I love it. Keeps me sharp.

### How Did You Build This?

I built this with the [Hylia Eleventy Starter Kit](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/hylia). The website is powered by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/). Since my GitHub repository is public, I only pay for my domain via [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) and analytics via Netlify!
