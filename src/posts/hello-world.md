Hello! It's been a long time since I had a personal blog on the web. It's been a long time since my days on Blogspot and WordPress, but I'm finally back.

The web used to be this vibrant place that was constantly evolving. Every website was like walking into a new artist's personal gallery. Websites were lightweight and fast, but they were still quirky and full of personality. Making your own site a simple endeavor that only required two simple languages: HTML, and CSS. If you spoke English, you were well on your way.

Today's web is more like a strip mall with 4 or 5 stores that everyone visits, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tik Tok. Everything is closed. You don't control or own your content. While social media has its perks, it's also a little boring. I want to break out of these walled gardens and return to the forest.

Consider this my way of adding a little more color back into the world.
