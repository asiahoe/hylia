2020 was an incredibly difficult year, and one of the major ways I coped was to double down on playing video games. Immersing myself in other worlds helped me escape from debilitating anxiety, grief, and loneliness, and bond with people all over the world. In a year that left me feeling powerless, paralyzed by the reality of back-to-back horrors in the world around me, I never imagined that I would take to such a dark and violent game as *[Dead By Daylight](https://deadbydaylight.com/en)*, the 2016 asymmetrical survival horror game from [Behavior Interactive](https://www.bhvr.com/).

Though I'm having a blast learning the game and playing with a passionate fanbase and friends, the *Dead By Daylight* community, like so many player-vs-player multiplayer titles, has a serious toxicity problem.

## Comfort in Terror



I first jumped into *Dead By Daylight* in October. Though Halloween was never going to be the same, I knew I could at least enjoy some spoopy content. Growing up, horror was very popular in my family. We would gather around for jump scares, gross outs, and lots of laughs. I rarely came to associate horror films with being truly scared. We spent most of the runtime roasting the victims for making ridiculous decisions, ultimately leading to their deaths. So I approached the game intending, for the most part, to laugh. Being consensually frightened is fun for me.



Just about the only character that ever gave me nightmares was Freddy Krueger. I still recall one nightmare vividly. In the dream, I sat at the kitchen table enjoying breakfast, light streaming in from the window, in what any Krueger survivor might assume was the safest environment to be. Except he was seated across from me at the table, sliding my carefully peeled boiled eggs onto each of his knives. As he taunted me with one of his signature jokes, the eggs bled. I woke from the dream in a hot sweat, uncertain of whether to laugh or cry. I shook it off and promptly went back to sleep.

With the exception of *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* (2003) and certain subsequent films of *Saw* (2004), which I found incredibly grotesque, erring on the side of torture porn, I generally love horror content, and video games are hardly an exception. In fact, *Resident Evil 2* was my first and most memorable foray into the survival horror genre, and one I absolutely intend to revisit on this blog, and on stream. I recently purchased the franchise on Steam after a ridiculous sale following the announcement of *Resident Evil 8*. For now, however, *Dead By Daylight* remains a mainstay in my PC library.



## Enter the Fog



If you're not familiar with asymmetric, they're essentially multiplayer games where the players have distinct roles with different gameplay. In the case of games like *Dead by Daylight*, teams are literally asymmetrical, as one killer attempts to sacrifice 4 survivors. The identity of the killer is not known to the survivors and vice versa, making it difficult to plan a build of specific perks and add-ons around the opposing team. Instead, there is a strong focus on tactics. Other than that, _Dead By Daylight_ is essentially a virtual game of Hide and Seek with some key mechanics designed to give you some unique advantages.
- As a killer, you have special abilities designed to help you trap, spook, and sacrifice survivors to a dark entity before they escape.
- Meanwhile, 4 survivors work together to evade, distract, stun, and escape the killer by fixing generators to power exit gates that allow them to flee to safety, before time runs out.
- A match ends when either the killer sacrifices all 4 survivors (what the community calls a "4K") or the survivors escape, either through one of the exits or a hatch which is hidden on the map.

The game delights with the inclusion of several licensed characters, including Freddy Krueger (The Nightmare), Michael Myers (The Shape), and Ashley Williams from the *Evil Dead* franchise, to name a few. Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash's voice actor, lending several of his famous catchphrases to the survivor. Groovy.

While it is relatively easy to pick up, _Dead By Daylight_ can be a challenge to master. It's appealing to survive with friends, but you can learn a lot by switching roles and taking down survivors as a killer, and vice versa. After all, it is best to know your enemy as well as you know yourself, improving your survivor and killer ranks as you progress.

The  different perks and add-ons for each character, bought with the game's core currency, "bloodpoints," which are selected from a procedurally generated, self-destructing "bloodweb." This simple mechanic ensures there's always a new way to play. The novelty of trying different characters, builds, and tactics, leveling up and matching with more challenging opponents, along with the joy of being scared, keeps me coming back for more.

## Killing in the Name

Now in my 5th month of playing the game, I have settled on two mains, namely The Wraith and The Clown. I have a strong preference for playing as killer, given the matchmaking times tend to be much faster by comparison.
- The Wraith uses a cloaking ability to gain the upper hand and surprise survivors who are not always able to detect his presence without certain perks. The Wraith doesn't seem very popular in The Fog, and this has actually been part of his appeal for me, along with his origin story.
- Slightly more challenging is the Clown, who throws two types of bottles, one for buffing himself, and one for slowing survivors, to take out his opponents from afar. I was really surprised that my throwing arm was relatively decent. It's been really fun to embody both of these characters.
- Frankly, I find the vast majority of the survivors to be mostly interchangeable, especially as you play with more of them overtime and unlock their universal perks for all of your characters. I'm not a player that spends a ton on collectibles like costumes, so this is even more true.

Still, part of the charm of the game is being able to try different characters and skills, so lately I've been working on The Nurse, an apparition who moves slowly but teleports to her prey on any floor of the map, and The Trapper, who lays down bear traps to capture his prey. The Nurse, being so slow, with an ability that punishes her after 2 uses or missed hits, is by far one of the most difficult killers to master.

However, it is really satisfying when you do finally begin to get it, flying across the map and freaking out your opponents. Unfortunately, usually don't take her too seriously under the assumption that most Nurse players are not at all skilled, and will often resort to trolling and teabagging, running well within arm's reach of her attack, but just far enough that she would never be able to catch up. A player who has the perks or mastery can easily slice through that behavior, but it can be a challenge if you are new to the character.

Trapper, on the other hand, is one of the recommended starting killers, and for good reason. His strategy is slow and methodical, and he moves relatively quickly. I've learned to place traps around common exit routes, near generators, and close to hooks.

## The Entity is Displeased



I won a game of Dead By Daylight on the Midwich Elementary School map from the Silent Hill series. I won the game and hooked all 4 survivors with a final score of 31,113. I'm just starting to learn Trapper, who requires some setup with bear traps to be successful. I often place traps around hooks and common escape routes. I usually struggle on this map, so I'm very proud of mysel Unfortunately survivors weren't too happy about my strategies with Trapper. The name calling and c
