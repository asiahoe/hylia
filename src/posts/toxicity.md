Being consensually frightened is fun for me.

In the game, you play either a killer with special abilities designed to help you trap, spook, and sacrifice survivors to a dark entity, or 

I won a game of Dead By Daylight on the Midwich Elementary School map from the Silent Hill series. I won the game and hooked all 4 survivors with a final score of 31,113. I'm just starting to learn Trapper, who requires some setup with bear traps to be successful. I often place traps around hooks and common escape routes. I usually struggle on this map, so I'm very proud of mysel Unfortunately survivors weren't too happy about my strategies with Trapper. The name calling and c
