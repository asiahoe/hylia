It's been some time since I seriously sat down and played a mobile game. For a short while, I played Eatventure, Sliding Seas, and sporadically play Beatstar, but they didn't quite satisfy the itch for one reason in particular; there was no real community element.

Growing up, I played a lot of multiplayer games, so I default to playing with friends. I think this is the biggest reason why I've always been more interested in Xbox and Nintendo over PlayStation. They both invested very heavily in team-based and family-oriented games respectively, while PlayStation originally seemed to be more suited to the lone gamer. That's obviously changed a lot since I was a kid, and mobile gaming's transformation isn't all that different as devices have become more powerful. My phone now rivals my PC, and that's incredible!

This week I was invited to play Clash of Clans and Honkai Star Rail. It is fascinating to see the depth these games have now, compared to when I got my first smartphone. Seeing that Clash of Clans has scaled to eSports levels of popularity since I first started playing absolutely blows my mind. While I doubt they'll keep me entertained for very long, sometimes it's fun to do something outside of my usual interests just to hang out with friends. I'm often pleasantly surprised.
